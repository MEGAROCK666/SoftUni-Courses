#Test for creation of the new folder.

In the dropdown menu that appears, select "Create new file."
In the "Name your file..." input box, enter the desired folder name followed by a forward slash ("/") and a placeholder file name. 
For example, if you want to create a folder named "my-folder," you could enter "my-folder/placeholder.md" as the file name.
Note: The placeholder file name is required because GitHub does not allow creating empty folders directly.
